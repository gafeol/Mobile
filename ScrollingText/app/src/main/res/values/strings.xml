        when he was 19 to start his undergraduate studies at Universidade

        Svizzera Italiana.
        \n\n
        The things that fascinates Pedro are those that are paradigm-
        breaking, ground-breaking, useful and that adds some sort of
        content to his person. He\'s very passionate about art, music,
        linguistics, literature and technoloy. His favorite hobbies are
        learning new languages, listenning to new music and feeling them
        as an experience. He also enjoys building new things - and he feels
        very fulfilled making things that would help people.
        \n\n
        One of his dreams are to cross the whole Americas (south, center
        and north) by car. And other aim of him is to build something that
        would transform the world in somewhere less unequal.
        \n\n
        Finally, he is very happy and proud to be in Lugano and he hopes
        that that experience helps him achieve his main objectives in life.
